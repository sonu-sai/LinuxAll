        <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
        <p>
          Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In
          fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is
          powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software
          that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your
          desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the
          communication between your software and your hardware. Without the
          operating system (OS), the software wouldn?t function.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Bootloader &#8211; </strong> The software that manages the
            boot process of your computer. For most users, this will simply be a
            splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the
            operating system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kernel &#8211;</strong> This is the one piece of the whole
            that is actually called ?Linux?. The kernel is the core of the
            system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The
            kernel is the lowest level of the OS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Init system &#8211;</strong> This is a sub-system that
            bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons.
            One of the most widely used init systems is systemd? which also
            happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system
            that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed
            over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Daemons </strong> These are background services (printing,
            sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after
            you log into the desktop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Graphical server </strong> This is the sub-system that
            displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as
            the X server or just X.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Desktop environment </strong> This is the piece that the
            users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to
            choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE,
            Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications
            (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and
            games).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Applications </strong> Desktop environments do not offer the
            full array of apps. Just like Windows and macOS, Linux offers
            thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be
            easily found and installed. Most modern Linux distributions (more on
            this below) include App Store-like tools that centralize and
            simplify application installation. For example, Ubuntu Linux has the
            Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME Software? Figure 1) which
            allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps and install
            them from one centralized location.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Why use Linux?</h2>
        <p>
          This is the one question that most people ask. Why bother learning a
          completely different computing environment, when the operating system
          that ships with most desktops, laptops, and servers works just fine?
        </p>
        <p>
          To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that
          operating system you?re currently using really work ?just fine?? Or,
          do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware, slow
          downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees?<br />If you
          struggle with the above, Linux might be the perfect platform for you.
          Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems on
          the planet. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you
          have the perfect solution for a desktop platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right, zero cost of entry as in free. You can install Linux on
          as many computers as you like without paying a cent for software or
          server licensing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If zero cost isnot enough to win you over? what about having an
          operating system that will work, trouble free, for as long as you use
          it? I have used Linux for nearly 20 years (as both a desktop and
          server platform) and have not had any issues with ransomware, malware,
          or viruses. Linux is generally far less vulnerable to such attacks. As
          for server reboots, they are only necessary if the kernel is updated.
          It is not out of the ordinary for a Linux server to go years without
          being rebooted. If you follow the regular recommended updates,
          stability and dependability are practically assured.
        </p>

        <h2>Open source</h2>
        <p>
          Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source
          follows these key tenants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
          <li>
            The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it
            do what you wish.
          </li>
          <li>
            The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
          </li>
          <li>
            The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
            others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These points are crucial to understanding the community that works
          together to create the Linux platform. Without a doubt, Linux is an
          operating system that is ?by the people, for the people?. These
          tenants are also a main factor in why many people choose Linux. It?s
          about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of choice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What is a distribution?</h2>
        <p>
          Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user.
          From new users to hard-core users, you&#8217;ll find a
          &#8220;flavor&#8221; of Linux to match your needs. These versions are
          called distributions (or, in the short form, &#8220;distros&#8221;).
          Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned
          onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as
          you like).
        </p>
        <p>Popular Linux distributions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>DEBIAN</li>
          <li>ELEMENTARY OS</li>
          <li>FEDORA</li>
          <li>LINUX MINT</li>
          <li>MANJARO</li>
          <li>OPENSUSE</li>
          <li>UBUNTU</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each distribution has a different take on the desktop. Some opt for
          very modern user interfaces (such as GNOME and Elementary OS's
          Pantheon), whereas others stick with a more traditional desktop
          environment (openSUSE uses KDE).
        </p>

        <p>
          And donot think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you
          can turn to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>
          <li>Ubuntu Server</li>
          <li>Centos</li>
          <li>SUSE Enterprise Linux</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of the above server distributions are free (such as Ubuntu Server
          and CentOS) and some have an associated price (such as Red Hat
          Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux). Those with an associated
          price also include support.
        </p>

        <h2>History of Linux</h2>
        <p>
          Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus
          Torvalds: to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting
          Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its
          history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has
          grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting
          commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than
          23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the
          GNU General Public License v2.
        </p>
        <h2>creation of Linux</h2>
        <p>
          In 1991, while studying computer science at University of Helsinki,
          Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the Linux kernel. He
          wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and
          independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the
          functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor. Development was done
          on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. The GNU C Compiler is still the
          main choice for compiling Linux today, but can be built with other
          compilers, such as the Intel C Compiler. As Torvalds wrote in his book
          Just for Fun, he eventually ended up writing an operating system
          kernel. On 25 August 1991, he (at age 21) announced this system in a
          Usenet posting to the newsgroup "comp.os.minix."
